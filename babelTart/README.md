# Text Analytics with Python
### A Practical Real-World Approach to Gaining Actionable Insights from your Data

Text analytics can be a bit overwhelming and frustrating at times
with the unstructured and noisy nature of textual data and the 
vast amount of information available. 
"Text Analytics with Python" is a book packed with 385 pages of useful information 
based on techniques, algorithms, experiences and various lessons learnt over time 
in analyzing text data. This repository contains datasets and code used in this book.
I will also be adding various notebooks and bonus content here from time to time. 
Keep watching this space!

## Help Needed on porting code to Python 3.x. Please check [this link](https://github.com/dipanjanS/text-analytics-with-python/issues/3) -- To be resumed end of August-September, 2017.

#### TODO

- [x] Add code used in the book
- [x] Add datasets used in the book
- [x] Add book description
- [ ] Update chapter descriptions
- [ ] Add necessary code comments & documentation
- [ ] Add code used in the book ported to Python 3.x (for people using Python 3)
- [ ] Add bonus content

Derive useful insights from your data using Python. 
Learn the techniques related to natural language processing and text analytics, 
and gain the skills to know which technique is best suited to solve a particular problem.

Text Analytics with Python teaches you both basic and advanced concepts, 
including text and language syntax, structure, semantics. 
You will focus on algorithms and techniques, such as text classification, 
clustering, topic modeling, and text summarization

A structured and comprehensive approach is followed in this book so that 
readers with little or no experience do not find themselves overwhelmed. 
You will start with the basics of natural language and Python and move on 
to advanced analytical and machine learning concepts. You will look at each 
technique and algorithm with both a bird's eye view to understand how it 
can be used as well as with a microscopic view to understand the mathematical 
concepts and to implement them to solve your own problems.

This book:
 - Provides complete coverage of the major concepts and 
 techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics
 - Includes practical real-world examples of techniques for implementation, 
  such as building a text classification system to categorize news articles, 
  analyzing app or game reviews using topic modeling and text summarization, 
  and clustering popular movie synopses and analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews
 - Shows implementations based on Python and several popular open source libraries 
 in NLP and text analytics, such as the natural language toolkit ([`nltk`](http://www.nltk.org/)),
